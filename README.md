In this thesis we are developing a system that informs the healthcare system to send help for
falls that have been detected by a mobile device.

The Web App is responsible for the visualization of the database. Through this visualization
the operator can decide which call for help to answer first and is able to know the exact route to
the fall location via a map (google maps).
